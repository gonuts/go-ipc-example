Go IPC example

This example shows how easy it is to use json-rpc for ipc in Go.

Json-rpc is heavily used for web serving.

Go lacks premium-grade gui functionality. The idea is to make a "buddy" gui app, 
written in any language of choice, and use json-rpc for communication with the 
app using stdin/stdout pipes.
